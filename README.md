# Module-6_Deliverables

## The purpose of this deliverable is to provide a functional travel guide based on weather data. 

### This is accomplished by pulling data from Google's API and following a 3 step process:
### 1) We retrieve weather data for a number of geocoordinates.
### 2) We pick cities with weather befitting the customer's wants.
### 3) We establish an itinerary for the customer based on the cities he picked.
### Attached is the code and screenshots for each step.
